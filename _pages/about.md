Hi everyone!, I'm Sahil, a final year student at IIT Bombay pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering along with a Minor in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I'm enthusiastic about machine learning, probability and statistics. Particularly, I'm interested in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Multimodal Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked under the guidance *[Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/)* on mitigating performance gaps in cross modal retreival using VLMs. We also developed a benchmark dataset to assess the generalization capabilities of VLMs. Our work was accepted at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

For my Bachelor's Thesis, I worked with *[Prof. Sharayu Moharir](https://sites.google.com/view/sharayu-homepage/home)* and derived bounds on the expected sample complexity of best arm identification in a grouped bandit scenario where each arm is constrained to have a mean above a threshold.

 I spent my third year summer as an AI Intern at *[AWL, Inc](https://awl.co.jp/en/company/)*. where I built end to end pipelines to solve computer vision tasks with VLMs and optimizing detector models. Additionally, I've also served as a teaching assistant for the course MA108 (Differential Equations - I), mentoring 40 first year UG students by addressing their course related queries and conducting weekly tutorials.

I love solving brain teasers and puzzles and I'm also exploring the field of quantitative analysis. I enjoy playing badminton and watching movies and TV shows.
